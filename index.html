<a id="project-overview" class="anchor" href="#project-overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Overview</h2>

<p>The Nomad GitHub project site houses and manages the code base for the Nomad Autonomous Robot (Nomad AR). The Nomad AR is, as its name implies, an autonomous robot being developed to participate in robotics competitions and serve as a learning platform for its developers.</p>

<p>The project is initially being developed for the 2016 Autonomous Vehicle Challenge (AVC) put on by Sparkfun. The exact dates have not been announced, but from the previous years we are expecting mid-June.</p>

<h3>
<a id="hardware" class="anchor" href="#hardware" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hardware</h3>

<p>Nomad AR is built on and named after a highly modified Nomad robot chassis from the Actobotics line from Servo City. We've added an Intel Edison as the primary processor and a Roboclaw 2x30 motor controller. It is driven by 4 planetary geared 12v motors. At the moment the entire thing is powered by a single 11.4v 3S LiPo battery, but we may be adding more battery packs as we expand the hardware. Future planned additions are a Kinect or other vision sensor with depth field capability, a wireless hub, and numerous IMU sensors.</p>

<h3>
<a id="software" class="anchor" href="#software" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Software</h3>

<p>The Edison processor runs a Linux OS. We are running Ubilinux which is based on Debian Wheezy. This is primarily due to its ease of use and documented compatibility with our chosen robotics middleware framework. For the middleware we have selected to use Robot Operating System (ROS). This was selected due to the breadth of capabilities available with minimal development on our part.</p>

<p>The custom nodes, services, and other code will likely be developed using Python with some more advanced packages developed in C++. Which language we use will be determined by the individual packages and who is doing the coding.</p>

<h2>
<a id="related-projects" class="anchor" href="#related-projects" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Related Projects</h2>

<p>As additional learning platforms, much of the code used in the Nomad project is first developed on one or more of our related projects. For me it's BARB. Other team members have their own learning platforms.</p>
